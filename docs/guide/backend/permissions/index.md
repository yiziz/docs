Ensuring the `type="module"` attribute is set for ClientLibs is import for AEM Vite to work. AEM Vite provide an authorizable user (`aem-vite-clientlibs`) that you will need to apply via a `rep:policy`.

## Access control

The first thing you will need to do is create a `.content.xml` file in your ClientLibs folder or the folder that you store your ClientLibs within. Add the following as its contents.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<jcr:root xmlns:jcr="http://www.jcp.org/jcr/1.0" xmlns:nt="http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0" xmlns:rep="internal"
    jcr:mixinTypes="[rep:AccessControllable]"
    jcr:primaryType="nt:folder"/>
```

## rep:policy

The final step is to allow the AEM Vite `aem-vite-clientlibs` user access to any ClientLibs under AEM Vite control. Create a file called `_rep_policy.xml` in the same folder as where you stored your `.content.xml` file.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<jcr:root xmlns:jcr="http://www.jcp.org/jcr/1.0" xmlns:rep="internal" jcr:primaryType="rep:ACL">
    <allow
        jcr:primaryType="rep:GrantACE"
        rep:principalName="aem-vite-clientlibs"
        rep:privileges="{Name}[jcr:all]"/>
</jcr:root>
```
